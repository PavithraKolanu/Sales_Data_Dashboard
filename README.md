# Sales_Data_Dashboard

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales performance across products, regions, customer segments, and sales channels. It highlights both financial outcomes (Sales, Profit) and operational drivers (Quantity, Discounts, Payment Methods). The story shows how different factors contribute to business growth and profitability.

1. Headline KPIs:

Total Sales: 465K – the overall revenue generated.

Total Profit: 667K – strong profitability despite discounts.
These KPIs confirm that the business is not only generating revenue but also maintaining profitability.

2. Sales Trends Over Time:

The line chart with Sales Channel legend shows that both Online and Retail sales fluctuate seasonally.

Retail dominates slightly but Online is catching up, suggesting a healthy multi-channel presence.
Insight: The business should leverage peak periods (e.g., mid-year spikes) for promotions.

3. Product Category Insights:

Furniture and Clothing lead in sales, while Food contributes significantly to profitability.

Electronics underperform in both sales and profit.
Insight: The company could optimize inventory and discounts in Electronics while doubling down on high-profit Food items.

4. Regional Insights:

East leads in sales, but South delivers the highest profit.

West and North regions also show strong contributions.
Insight: This suggests different strategies: push sales growth in East, but maximize margin optimization in South.

5. Customer & Channel Insights:

New Customers (260K) contribute more than Returning (205K).

Retail sales (239K) slightly outperform Online (226K).
Insight: The business is successfully acquiring new customers, but retention strategies may need strengthening.

6. Payment Insights:

Bank Transfer (208K) is the most common payment method, followed by Credit Card (140K).

Cash (117K) lags behind.
Insight: Offering more digital payment options may continue to align with customer preferences.

7. Discounts and Profitability:

A scatter analysis indicates a slightly negative relationship between Discounts and Profit.
Insight: Heavy discounting does not necessarily increase profitability; smarter promotions are needed.

8. Conclusion:
This dashboard shows that:

The business is profitable with strong customer acquisition.
Food and South region are profit engines.
Electronics and customer retention are weak spots.
Discounts should be used more strategically.

The company should focus on high-margin categories, enhance retention strategies, and fine-tune discounts while continuing to leverage both Online and Retail sales channels.
